The aged paper, careful pencil entries, and itemized totals reflect a time when community stores kept running tallies for local families, and buyers purchased ingredients in small, practical amounts rather than in bulk.",

A note like this shows that farm superintendents often acted not just as managers, but as bookkeepers, community intermediaries, and problem-solvers who relied on personal relationships to settle debts. Addressing John Kirkpatrick suggests he held a position that involved financial oversight or customer accounts, indicating he was someone the farm relied on for judgment and local connections. The letter also hints at the informal nature of business at that time, when collecting money often depended on who you knew rather than on formal systems. Including a line congratulating Kirkpatrick on his new appointment suggests he was moving upward in responsibility within the regional farming or delivery network, showing his reputation mattered in these circles." ,

The stone tool on display represents the kind of artifact often found in local fields and riverbanks, reminders that Lenape communities lived, traveled, and traded throughout the Raritan Valley. The doll evokes Lenape clothing traditions, beadwork, and storytelling practices that families used to teach children about identity and heritage.

She was born on January 10, 1829, as one of twelve children of Abidjan and Mary Mount, a large household typical of rural families who relied on many hands to manage farm work and domestic responsibilities. The family lived in the house along Route 33 West, a property that still stands today and represents the kind of multi-generational homestead common in that era. Achsah never married and lived her entire life within the family network, which likely meant participating in household labor, helping raise younger siblings, and contributing to farm operations. She lived to the age of 72, passing away in a period when many women’s lives were centered around family, land, and community ties. The portrait shown in the display, dated to the 1860s, is one of the few surviving images of her and provides a rare glimpse into the appearance and daily world of someone who otherwise would not have been widely documented in public records.",

Spinning wheels like this one were used to twist raw fibers—such as wool, flax, or cotton—into yarn or thread that could later be woven into fabric. The large wheel was turned by hand to power the spindle, and the operator fed fibers in gradually to control the thickness and strength of the thread. A setup like this typically sat in the main living area of a home, since spinning was a regular chore that could be done while supervising children or tending the household fire. The cones of yarn placed on the bench here illustrate the finished product that the wheel helped create. A wheel of this size and style suggests it was used for producing longer, finer thread rather than heavy rope, and it reflects the kind of home-based textile work that was essential before manufactured cloth became widely available." ,

Before widespread access to state-issued birth certificates, death certificates, and centralized civil record systems, churches were often the primary institutions responsible for keeping track of personal milestones. A pastor used a record book like this to log baptisms, births, marriages, confirmations, membership changes, and deaths within the community. These entries served as official proof of identity, age, and family relationships when no government registry existed or when rural areas lacked local clerks. Such books were also used to track pastoral visits, spiritual concerns, and major family events, creating a long-term chronicle of the community’s history. Many early genealogical records survive today because ministers maintained detailed volumes like this one, making them valuable sources for tracing family lines and documenting local life before the establishment of formal vital records systems.",

Unlike later gramophones that used flat discs, this type of phonograph played wax cylinders like the one shown beside it. The large metal horn amplified the sound mechanically, since these machines predate electric speakers. To operate it, the user wound a hand crank to power the mechanism, placed a wax cylinder onto the rotating mandrel, and lowered a small stylus onto the surface. As the cylinder turned, the stylus traced grooves that captured vibrations from the original recording, reproducing the sound through the horn. Machines like this were common from the late 1800s through the early 1900s and were found in homes, schools, and community halls. They were used for music, spoken-word recordings, and even early dictation. The cylinder container next to the phonograph is original packaging, often printed with the performer’s portrait or the title of the recording. This setup represents one of the earliest practical ways people could listen to recorded sound, long before vinyl records, radio, or modern audio technology.",

The cardboard tube protected the cylinder inside, which was made of a hardened wax formula designed to produce clearer, longer-lasting playback than earlier soft-wax recordings. The phrase “Echo All Over the World” was a marketing slogan used by Edison to promote the reach and reliability of his recording technology at a time when cylinder records were still a new form of home entertainment. Each container was labeled with the brand, the manufacturing plant, and often the name of the performer or recording once the cylinder was placed inside. Containers like this were essential because wax cylinders were fragile and could easily crack without protection. This piece represents the packaging that accompanied one of the earliest commercially distributed sound recordings in history." ,

Before the 1960s, women typically wore separate stockings that came up only to the thigh. To keep them from slipping down, they used devices like these—elastic cords or bands that fastened just above the knee. The cords were tightened enough to hold the stocking in place but loose enough to avoid discomfort. Garter cords and garter belts were everyday clothing accessories for decades, and they were considered as essential as shoes or gloves in a woman’s wardrobe. This example shows the type of practical garment hardware that was part of women’s daily dressing long before stretch nylon made full pantyhose possible.",

Sheets like this were included with home sewing machines to guide owners in choosing the correct needles and thread for different types of fabric, since early machines were very sensitive to needle size and quality. The chart lists which needle numbers to use with various weights of cotton and silk thread, reflecting the standardized sewing system of the period. The document also contains a strong warning about “bogus needles,” emphasizing that only genuine Florence flat-shank needles should be used—common language for manufacturers at the time, since counterfeit or incompatible needles could damage the machine. It even instructs owners not to let repairmen from other companies work on the machine, reminding users that unauthorized repairs could void the guarantee. This sheet shows how early sewing machine companies protected their products, instructed new owners, and helped standardize home sewing long before modern instruction manuals were common.",

The figures—typically inspired by Rococo fashion with powdered wigs, embroidered coats, and full gowns—were meant to evoke elegance and refinement rather than depict specific historical individuals. The painted blue-and-white detailing reflects a common color palette used in European-style decorative ceramics.

In its earliest years, railroad cars on this route were pulled by horses until 1833, when the English-built John Bull steam locomotive replaced horse-drawn service. The plaque notes that the original rails were laid on granite blocks known as “sleepers,” several of which have been preserved on site. These stone supports were later replaced by wooden ties, which offered smoother and more reliable travel. By 1871, the Camden & Amboy Railroad had been absorbed into the Pennsylvania Railroad system, reflecting the consolidation of early American railroads into larger networks.

The white farmhouse, with its simple lines and side chimney, reflects the practical architecture common to New Jersey farm homes in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern ramp provides accessibility for visitors while maintaining the building’s historic character. The large tree beside the house—glowing with autumn color—anchors the yard and hints at the long-term growth and seasonal rhythms of farm life. In the distance, additional structures can be seen, including the barn and the one-room schoolhouse, both part of the larger historic site that interprets community life in Monroe Township. The open fields and wide sky surrounding the home emphasize the agricultural roots of the property and the spaciousness typical of early farmsteads. Today, this view serves as both a welcoming entrance and an orientation point for exploring the full Dey Farm Historic Site.",

Inside the box are period writing tools, including a dip-pen with a metal nib and a simple wooden pencil. Boxes like this were durable enough to last for years and were often one of the few personal items a student brought to a one-room schoolhouse.",

Each image captures a different schoolhouse, usually a single classroom heated by a stove and taught by one teacher who managed all grades at once. Schools like Prospect Plains (c. 1890), Pleasant Hill (c. 1908), Half-Acre, and Dey Grove were spaced throughout farming communities so children could walk from nearby homes. Many of these buildings were later converted into private residences or community spaces once larger, consolidated schools opened in the mid-20th century. The photographs also document the students and teachers who worked in these tight, multigrade environments, offering a snapshot of everyday education in rural New Jersey at the turn of the century." ,

Here you can see how the barn sits in relation to the farmhouse and the adjacent outbuildings—laid out in a practical cluster that reflects how 19th-century farms organized work, livestock, and storage. Standing between the two barn entrances gives you a sense of how wagons, animals, and equipment would have moved in and out throughout the day. The smaller reddish outbuilding beside the barn hints at specialized uses—often these structures served as smokehouses, tool sheds, or animal shelters depending on the season. The layout of the paths and the open fields surrounding it helps you picture the original working landscape long before modern development filled in the area.",

The long sheaves of grain and the string of whole corn ears are set up the way farmers would dry seed and feed after harvest. Suspending them in the open air of the barn kept them off the damp ground, away from rodents, and allowed air to circulate so mold didn’t set in. Some of this grain would later be threshed and ground, while the best ears of corn were kept as seed for the next year’s planting. Nearby, ladders, baskets, and crates show how everything had to be lifted, carried, and sorted by hand. The small “Chas. Dey Jr.” farm sign on the wall ties these everyday tasks back to an actual local family whose name is still part of Monroe’s history.",

Overhead, the repeating curves of the white rafters show off the barn’s modern reconstruction, built to echo the shape of historic wagon sheds. On the gravel pad beneath, you can see rusted iron machinery with big spoked wheels—likely seeders, cultivators, or rakes that would have been pulled by horses or early tractors across fields like the ones in front of you. Parking them here kept the metal out of the weather while leaving plenty of room in the main barn for animals and hay. The long shadows and open grass beyond also give a good sense of scale: this was working farmland, not just a single building. From here you can look back into the barn interior on one side and out toward the house and schoolhouse on the other, tying all the pieces of Dey Farm together.",

A lace tablecloth is spread over a rolling table, arranged with wooden fruits and enamelware to echo wartime rationing and farmhouse kitchens. Behind it, the white wall becomes a timeline of muscle-powered technology: a push plow, seed drill, and early mower lean next to milk cans, a floor scale, and other hand tools that kept a small farm running long before tractors took over. The mix of the military vehicle to one side and the modest tools and food display on the other hints at how global events like war and rationing reached right into places like Dey Farm, changing what families grew, ate, and used every day.",

A row of long, heavy wooden handles is mounted vertically against a paneled wall, each ending in a different working head: a multi-tined fork for lifting hay or manure, a wide curved cutting blade for mowing or clearing brush, and other pronged tools for turning soil or pulling loose stalks. Beside them is a small stand holding a battered metal bucket and a low wooden trough on the floor, hinting at watering animals or soaking feed. Small colored labels are pinned above several pieces, inviting visitors to match each tool to its purpose like a guessing game. Taken together, the display shows how one farm family once needed a specialized tool for nearly every task—from cutting and gathering crops to cleaning stalls—long before tractors and powered attachments took over the same jobs.",

Unlike the brighter green tractors nearby, this machine has a darker, weathered finish and tall spoked wheels that make it easy to spot once you know where to look. Built in the late 1910s by the Moline Plow Company, the Model D was designed as a compact, all-purpose tractor that could pull many different implements, allowing one engine to do the work of several teams of horses. It used a four-cylinder gasoline engine and, for its time, had modern touches like an electric starter and lights, so farmers didn’t have to hand-crank the engine or stop working at sunset.

        "summary": "This section of the equipment barn highlights how tractor design changed once farmers needed machines that could work cleanly between crop rows. The green tractor on the right is a 1929 John Deere General Purpose, one of John Deere’s early attempts to replace horses with a single machine that could pull plows, power belt-driven tools, and cultivate crops. Its wide stance and rugged frame made it a reliable all-rounder on mixed farms. Just to its side is the brownish tractor with red wheels: a 1933 Hart-Parr 1B-27 Row-Crop. Unlike the heavier, fixed-width tractors that came before, row-crop models like this were built with higher clearance and adjustable wheel spacing so farmers could drive right down the corn or potato rows without crushing the plants. Together, these two machines show the move from general, horse-replacement tractors toward more specialized designs that matched the layout of modern row-crop fields.",

          "Row-crop tractors were built with higher ground clearance and adjustable wheel width to pass between crop rows without damaging plants.",
          "Both tractors would have powered not just field work but also belt-driven equipment like corn shellers and grain grinders.",

In the middle of the shot, a red grinding or sharpening wheel and other small tools hint at how much maintenance these older implements required: a lot of time at the grinder keeping blades and edges sharp. The lace-covered table in front softens the scene a bit, with a display of wooden boards and produce that connect this machinery back to real household tasks like cutting, pressing, and food preparation.
