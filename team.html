            <h2>Our Co-Founders</h2>
            <p>We're Anvi and Arav, students at Monroe Township High School and proud members of the Mayor's Youth Advisory Council. Our journey began during a collaboration with the Historic Preservation Committee, where we discovered a profound disconnect. A wealth of local history, like the Dey Farm just minutes from our home, was largely inaccessible to our community. Realizing that a town's story is only powerful if it can be heard, we were driven by a single mission to unlock the past for the digital generation. TARDIS was born from that passion, a way to ensure the rich heritage of places like our own is not just preserved, but experienced.</p>

              <h2>Our Advisors</h2>
              <p>An ambitious idea requires exceptional guidance. As the advisors to the Mayor's Youth Advisory Council and respected leaders within the Historic Preservation Committee, Kyle Johanesson and Councilwoman Siegel have been the bedrock of this project. Their mentorship transformed our initial spark into a fully realized vision. We are immensely grateful for their wisdom, their dedication to our community, and their belief in the power of this project to connect our past with our future.</p>
